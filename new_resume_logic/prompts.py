def get_metadata_extraction_prompt(text):
    """Returns the prompt for extracting structured metadata from resume text"""
    return f"""
You are an expert resume parser. Extract a clean, structured JSON from the resume text below.

Rules for extraction (balanced and practical):
1) Grounded extraction (no hallucination)
   - Use only information present in the resume text.
   - Prefer literal text, but you MAY infer skills and entities if they are clearly implied by experience/projects/achievements.
   - Do NOT invent degrees, employers, or dates that are not present.

2) Skills extraction (flexible and comprehensive)
   - Include skills listed in a dedicated Skills/Technical Skills section if present.
   - ALSO include skills clearly mentioned in experience, projects, summary, or achievements (e.g., "Developed microservices using Java and Spring Boot" â†’ add ["Java", "Spring Boot"]).
   - Normalize skill tokens (trim, deduplicate, keep concise terms like "AWS", "Kubernetes", "TensorFlow").

3) Work experience structure
   - Extract as an array of objects with fields: job_title, company, start_date, end_date, description.
   - Dates can be any textual form present (e.g., "Jan 2021 - Present"). If missing, use null.

4) Certifications, projects, education
   - Return arrays. Each item may be a string or an object with name/title and optional details.
   - Do not fabricate items; include only what the text supports.

5) Contact & personal info
   - Extract full_name, email, phone, location if present; otherwise use null.

6) Output quality
   - Keep arrays concise and deduplicated.
   - Use proper JSON only. No markdown, no comments, no extra text.

Required JSON schema:
{{
  "full_name": string|null,
  "email": string|null,
  "phone": string|null,
  "location": string|null,
  "skills": string[],
  "work_experience": [
    {{

      "company": string|null,
      "start_date": string|null,
      "end_date": string|null,
      "description": string|null
    }}
  ],
  "certifications": [string|object],
  "projects": [string|object],
  "education": [string|object],
  "summary": string|null
}}

Resume text:

Return ONLY the JSON object.
